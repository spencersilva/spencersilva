                    <p class="meta">East Bay Express, 9/4/19</p>
                    <p>I reported a story about an Oakland junior college football team that overcame wildfires, locker room theft, and internal strife to win the 2018 state championship, only to have their triumph tempered when a freshman lineman was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The story earned an honorable mention in the 2020 Best American Sports anthology.</p>

                    <p>I wrote a feature exploring how PG&E's 2019 bankruptcy threatened to derail a historic land conservation deal in which the company agreed to return tens of thousands of acres of California wilderness to Native tribes and conservation groups â€” including a Northern Sierra valley to its ancestral Maidu stewards.</p>

                    <p>I investigated how Bay Area cities and counties grappled with California legalizing recreational marijuana in radically different ways. My reporting revealed a patchwork of confusing local regulations that often contradicted their residents' overwhelming support for Prop 64. The story was a finalist for the Society of Professional Journalists' Mark of Excellence award.</p>

                    <p>I wrote a profile of the actor Michael Horse, best known as Deputy Hawk from Twin Peaks, that detailed his emergence as a prominent ledger artist, a form of protest art that involves painting tribal scenes over colonizer documents.</p>

                    <p class="meta">Oakland Magazine, 2017</p>
                    <p>I used the temporary closure of a popular dog park due to lead contamination as a starting point to explore the East Bay shoreline's transformation from pristine marshland to an industrial dumping ground to a modern recreational space. The story revealed how a carefully contained toxic legacy sometimes bubbles up in the present.</p>

                    <p>I found that Fox News devoted just one minute to covering Qatar's migrant worker deaths during its 2022 World Cup coverage. The network's silence coincided with Qatar Airways' major sponsorship of Fox Sports' tournament coverage.</p>
